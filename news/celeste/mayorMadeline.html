        <h2>Celeste Protagonist Madeline Announces Candidacy for Mayor of Mountain Town</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>In a shocking turn of events, Madeline, the protagonist of the popular video game Celeste, has announced her candidacy for Mayor of Mountain Town.

            Speaking at a press conference outside the Celestial Resort, Madeline said, "I believe that Mountain Town deserves a leader who understands the struggles of everyday people. As someone who has climbed a treacherous mountain and faced her inner demons, I know what it takes to overcome obstacles and achieve great things."
            
            The announcement has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with many wondering how a fictional character could possibly run for public office. However, Madeline has already gained a significant following on social media, with fans of the game praising her courage and determination.
            
            Political analysts have speculated that Madeline's campaign could be a sign of growing disillusionment with traditional politics and a desire for more unconventional candidates. Some have even suggested that Madeline's success could pave the way for other fictional characters to enter the political arena.
            
            At the press conference, Madeline was asked about her policy positions, but she declined to give specifics, saying only that she was committed to "making Mountain Town a better place for everyone."
            
            As of now, it remains unclear how Madeline's campaign will unfold or whether she will be able to overcome the legal and logistical hurdles of running for public office.</h3>
